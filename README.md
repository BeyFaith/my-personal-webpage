#### By **Bey Faith**
## Description
I had the idea of making my own portfolio a long time ago but was unable to do so, since i didn't know how to code and the website developers I knew at the time were costly. So, I learnt how to code and now you can be able to see me online. 
When you land on my portfolio, you will see a navigation bar which contains different sections. The first one which is the Welcome section, shows you who I am and what I do. The second section- the About me section shows my proffessional background,hobbies and interests. The skills section, shows you my professional skills. The Projects section shows the projects I am working on or have worked on as a developer. Lastly,the contacts section is where you can find my contact information in case you want to reach out to me or check on me online.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Once you land on my page click on the Welcome section, you will see me!

## Technologies Used
On my portfolio, I only used HTML and CSS as the languages to make up my website. The tools I used, I used git to track my changes and used GitHub to establish my code online.
