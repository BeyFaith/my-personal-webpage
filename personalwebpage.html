    <h1>FAITH</h1>
    <p>I am currently a student at Moringa School doing Software Development.I am a mother and a wife, I decided to start my coding journey  because I was involved in an unsatisfying career at the moment and it was not yielding results in terms of professional growth and ofcourse money wise! And my dream is to provide a legacy for my family,something to look back to and be glad that I started. Honestly, ever since I started my journey it's been all fun!!</p>
