      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student at Moringa School doing Software Development.I am a mother and a wife,<br>I decided to start my coding journey  because I was involved in an unsatisfying career, which was not yielding results<br> in terms of professional growth and ofcourse money wise!And my dream is to provide a legacy for my family;something to look<br> back to and be glad that I started. Honestly, ever since I started my journey it's been all fun!!</p>
      <p>I am a people's person; I really love to meet and interact with new people, reading books-any kind of books :) and I love vacations with my<br> loved ones especially my family!</p>
